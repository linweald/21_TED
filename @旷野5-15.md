4. I promptly turned bright red.
5. I understand that this is part of the deal.
6. It's just a fling.
7. The 36 questions seem to have taken on a life of their own.
8. What I want from love is a guarantee, not just that I am loved today and that I will be loved tomorrow, but that I will continue to be loved by the person I love indefinitely.
