###金句：

----------

1. We recognize patterns to distinguish noise from signal, and especially our name.
1. Most people are entirely unconscious of these filters.
1. When I married my wife, I promised her I would listen to her every day as if for the first time.
1. Now that's something I fall short of on a daily basis.
1. I would suggest that our listening is the main way that we experience the flow of time from past to future. 
1. We invented ways of recording -- first writing, then audio recording and now video recording as well.
1. Many people take refuge in headphones.
1. That means it's harder for us to pay attention to the quiet, the subtle, the understated.
1. A world where we don't listen to each other at all is a very scary place indeed.
1. That's too much to ask for most people.
