1. But what if we could watch entire lives as they unfold through time?
1. Nobody moves the ball further down the field. 
1. Some climbed the social ladder from the bottom all the way to the very top, and some made that journey in the opposite direction.

1. The clearest message that we get from this 75-year study is this: Good relationships keep us happier and healthier. Period.
1. It’s not just the number of friends you have, and it's not whether or not you're in a committed relationship, but it's the quality of your close relationships that matters.
