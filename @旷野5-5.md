1. I've had and from research that this stagnation, despite hard work, turns out to be pretty common.

1. They go through life deliberately alternating between two zones: the learning zone and the performance zone.

1. To speak more clearly despite a lisp, he went through his speeches with stones in his mouth.

1. This has been shown to be true in teaching, general medicine, nursing and other fields, and it happens because once we think we have become good enough, adequate, then we stop spending time in the learning zone.

1. So the way to high performance is to alternate between the learning zone and the performance zone, purposefully building our skills in the learning zone, and then applying those skills in the performance zone.

1. First, we must believe and understand that we can improve what we call a growth mindset.

###今日得到：
1、活动的两个区域：Learning zone and Performing zone. 在学习区要不断地挑战自己的现有边界，获得累加性增长；表演区是练习区域，是学习区的释放。乔布斯可以对着PPT不厌其烦的练上100遍，而在发布会仅仅会展现一个小时的时间。

2、环境塑造一个人的思想，没有环境的时候就给自己创设一个可以提高的环境。
